Description:
Time series of open water evaporation of Lake IJssel, the Netherlands. 
Data was collected at locations Stavoren and Trintelhaven at 7.5 m and 10.8 above land surface, respectively, from 2019 to 2020.
Data was collected using the eddy covariance instrument of the type IRGASON at a sampling frequency of 20 Hz. 
Variables Tair and RH were collected using a separate HMP155A instrument at a height of 7.4 m and 10.9 above surface in Stavoren and Trintelhaven, respectively. 
The eddy covariance data was processed using the EddyPro software at an averaging interval of 30-min.
